Thesis Statement: Adaptive Fraud Detection in Payment Systems

Fraud detection in payment systems is a complex and evolving challenge that necessitates adaptive, 
data-driven methodologies beyond traditional supervised learning approaches. While conventional models 
such as logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods have demonstrated effectiveness, 
they often struggle to adapt to emerging fraud patterns due to their reliance on static historical data. 
This thesis proposes an advanced fraud detection framework that integrates Graph Convolutional Networks 
(GCNs), Reinforcement Learning (RL), self-inferencing mechanisms, and causal inference to enhance detection 
accuracy, adaptability, and interpretability.

Key Components of the Proposed Model:
Baseline Supervised Learning: Establishing a benchmark using traditional classification models to evaluate 
their limitations in handling dynamic fraud patterns.

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs): Utilizing graph-based representations to capture intricate 
relationships between transactions, users, and devices, thereby detecting fraudulent behaviors that operate 
within complex networks.

Reinforcement Learning (RL): Implementing adaptive learning through actor-critic methods like Advantage 
Actor-Critic (A2C) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to continuously refine fraud detection policies 
based on real-time feedback.

Self-Inferencing Mechanism: Incorporating meta-learning and online learning strategies to allow the model 
to autonomously adjust to shifts in fraud behavior and optimize its detection performance over time.

Causal Inference: Distinguishing true fraud indicators from spurious correlations using Structural Causal 
Models (SCMs) and counterfactual reasoning, ensuring a reduction in false positives and enhanced model 
interpretability.

Progressive Evaluation Framework:
The model's effectiveness is validated through a stepwise evaluation process, incrementally incorporating
GCNs, RL, and causal inference to quantify their individual and combined contributions to fraud detection.
 Metrics such as AUC-ROC, precision-recall, time-to-detect new fraud patterns, and interpretability measures 
 are used to assess improvements over baseline models.

Conclusion:
By leveraging the synergy of GCNs, RL, self-inferencing, and causal inference, this research aims to provide 
a robust and empirically justified solution to the challenges posed by evolving payment fraud. The proposed
 approach not only enhances fraud detection accuracy but also ensures that the system remains adaptive to 
 emerging threats while maintaining high interpretability. This study underscores the necessity of 
 integrating advanced AI techniques to safeguard financial systems from sophisticated fraudulent activities.
