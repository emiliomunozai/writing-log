We sometimes forget that traditional machine learning, by this we refere to more establish algorithms, 
are powerful correlations machines. And, eventhough correlation is the main option it works until it
dosent. The whole Idea of causal machine learning is to try and find the world models that actually 
mediate relationships and how data is just a description of this relation. The great question is how
do you build ML models that focus in finding this causation relationships. This entry tries to describe
the evolution of this discipline from econometrics to current top of the line machine learning.

Causation studies are as old as humans, correlation or maybe causation? the sure thing is that we are
interesented in learning actual causes of the world around us. There is a study that ask kids about
where does the wind comes from and its not clear when we learn about causality but they are really bad.
Kids answer that it come from trees moving their branches, they got it backwards. But how do they learn
afterwards?

Well, we can first start describing how we, as a species, have come to understand this. Lets start with
the pioneers in understanding this phenomena. We have economists and their econometric models, its even
called the study of causality. <introduce explanation of econometrics>

The other fine approach is using machine learning to determine causality. <introduce explanation>

The question arises on how can this be useful for reinforcemnt learning.
